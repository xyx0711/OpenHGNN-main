# RSHN[ICDM2019]

-   paper: [Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8970828)
-   Code from author: [RSHN](https://github.com/CheriseZhu/RSHN)

## How to run

- Clone the Openhgnn-DGL

  ```bash
  python main.py -m RSHN -t node_classification -d aifb -g 0
  ```

  If you do not have gpu, set -gpu -1.

  Supported Dataset: [RDFDataset](../../dataset/#RDF_NodeCLassification)

## Performance: Node classification

| Method             | AIFB      | MUTAG     | BGS       | AM        |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| **RSHN**           | **97.22** | **82.35** | **93.10** | **90.40** |
| **RSHN(openhgnn)** | **97.22** | **85.29** | **93.10** | **89.39** |

The experiments in RSHN have serious problems according to the official code. First, it does not use validation set, and just tune hyperparameters on test set. Second, it reports the accuracy at the epoch with best accuracy on test set in the paper. And in this setting, we give our performance.

## TrainerFlow: [node classification flow](../../trainerflow/#Node classification flow)

### Model

- *1) Coarsened Line Graph Neural Network (CL-GNN):*
  - We implement the API [coarsened_line_graph](../../sampler/RSHN_sampler.py)
- *2) Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (H-GNN):*

## Hyper-parameter specific to the model

You can modify the parameters in openhgnn/config.ini

#### Description

```python
# The next two hyper-parameters are used in building the coarsened-line graph.
rw_len = 5
batch_size = 1000
#	edga_layer means number of CL-GNN layers, node_layer means number of H-GNN layers
num_node_layer = 2
num_edge_layer = 1
```

Best config can be found in [best_config](../../utils/best_config.py)
